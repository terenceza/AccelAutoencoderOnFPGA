The Autoencoder training algorithm was architectured and developed using the AMD HLS development suite, and executed on the simulation tool for the Xilinx XC7020 chip.
Under Doc directory are a few slides illustrating some of the critical architecture decisions to be made, as well as benchmarking execution time of the 
FPGA@100Mhz vs. Intel-7@4Ghz.
